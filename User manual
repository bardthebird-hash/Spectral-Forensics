SPECTRAL FORENSICS // OPERATOR MANUAL

Welcome to the Spectral Forensics System. This manual covers the operational modules of the v2.0 TUI.

1. The Interface Layout

The system is divided into two main zones:

Sidebar (Left):

System Target: Displays live CPU and RAM usage of the local machine.

Navigator: A directory tree for browsing the file system.

Main Content (Right):

Contains the operational tabs (File System, Live Processes, Network, Remote Uplink, Case Report).

2. File System Forensics

Use this module to analyze specific files found via the Navigator in the sidebar.

Select a File: Click any file in the sidebar tree.

Metadata Tab:

Displays file size, permissions (rwx), and timestamps (Created/Modified).

Action: Click "Add Metadata to Case" to save these details to your report.

Hex Dump Tab:

Shows the first 512 bytes of the file in a classic Hex editor view.

Useful for identifying file headers (magic numbers) to verify file types.

Hashing Tab:

Action: Click "Calculate Hashes" to generate MD5 and SHA256 fingerprints.

Action: Click "Add Hash to Case" to save the hashes to your report.

3. Live System Monitoring

Live Processes Tab

This tab helps you identify suspicious activity or resource hogs.

View: Displays the top 50 processes sorted by Memory Usage.

Columns: PID (Process ID), Name, User, Status, Memory %.

Action: Click "Refresh Processes" to update the list instantly.

Network Tab

This tab detects active connections, useful for spotting malware beacons or unauthorized remote access.

View: Lists open sockets and established connections.

Columns: Protocol (TCP/UDP), Local Address, Remote Address, Connection Status, PID.

Note: Some connections may show "Access Denied" if you do not run the script with sudo privileges.

4. Remote Uplink (SSH)

Use this module to connect to other machines (servers, headless Raspberry Pis) without leaving the dashboard.

Input Fields:

Hostname/IP: The IP address of the target.

Username: SSH login user.

Password: SSH login password (hidden input).

Command: The Linux command you wish to execute (e.g., ls -la, cat /var/log/syslog).

Action: Click "Execute Command".

Output: The result (stdout) or error (stderr) will appear in the log window below the buttons.

5. Reporting

As you analyze the system, you collect evidence. This tab compiles it.

Case Log: Displays a chronological list of all evidence you have "Added to Case" from other tabs.

Generate Report:

Click "Generate PDF Report".

The system will create a file named forensic_report.pdf in the current directory.

The PDF includes a timestamp, header, and formatted evidence blocks.

Troubleshooting

"Paramiko library not found": You are missing the SSH library. Run pip install paramiko.

"FPDF library not installed": You are missing the PDF library. Run pip install fpdf2.

Permission Errors: If you cannot read certain files or see network PIDs, try running the application with sudo python spectral_forensics.py.
